print(circumference)
print("----------------------")
// End of question 2


// 3. Declare a variable with a value of 98.8Â°F, convert it to Celsius, and round it to two decimal places. Then, print the result in the following format using a single print statement. [Replace the **** with converted celsius value.]
// Fahrenheit: 98.8 F
// Celsius:    ****
var fahrenheit:Double=98.8
var celsius:Double=(fahrenheit-32)*5/9
celsius=(celsius*100).rounded()/100
print("Fahrenheit: \(fahrenheit) F\nCelsius:    \(celsius) C")
print("----------------------")
// End of question 3
